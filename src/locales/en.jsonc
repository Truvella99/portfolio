      "description": "Project of the Web Applications 2 course, made in <a href='https://kotlinlang.org/' target='_blank'>Kotlin</a> by using the <a href='https://spring.io/' target='_blank'>Spring</a> framework. The goal was to develop a system for temporary job placement services based on spring microservices as backend, and then a user-friendly front-end that provides seamless access to all required and offered functionalities. All that was implemented by creating all the needed microservices, an API gateway as a bridge beetween them and the front-end, and by leveraging on other well-known frameworks to handle other requirements. The <a href='https://www.keycloak.org/' target='_blank'>Keycloak IAM</a> was used to handle authentication, while <a href='https://camel.apache.org/' target='_blank'>Apache Camel</a> was used to handle the reception of e-mails on gmail and forward it to the microservice. Also <a href='https://kafka.apache.org/' target='_blank'>Apache Kafka</a> has been used  to handle service downtime and <a href='https://debezium.io/' target='_blank'>Debezium</a> to implement the Outbox pattern where needed and guarantee transactionality. Finally, observability and monitoring on the system has been implemented through the usage of <a href='https://grafana.com/oss/loki/' target='_blank'>Loki</a> as log aggregation data source, and <a href='https://prometheus.io/' target='_blank'>Prometheus</a> as metric data source. All was displayed through <a href='https://grafana.com/' target='_blank'>Grafana</a> dashboards.

The goal of the project (called GLUTEN-HUB) is to design and implement an application to allow celiacs people to browse several restaurants available, see the offered dishes and ingredients in depth. All this done in order to make them feel safer about the quality of what they will eat, without the risk of feel sick. To achieve this, a focus on the ingredients provenience, as well as quality and safety of the offered products was considered inside the application. The project was made with the <a href='https://react.dev/' target='_blank'>React framework</a>, using <a href='https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/' target='_blank'>React Bootstrap</a> for styling and <a href='https://nodejs.org/en' target='_blank'>NodeJs</a> as runtime environment.",

Purpose of the thesis is to describe the implementation of a cross platform application to support a healtier lifestyle. After a general overview about health guidelines and the system (design, requirement, technolgical stack) the thesis discuss about the actual implementation of the app, the achieved performances and eventual future addition that will be performed, as well as a web application on admin side to allow the editing of some app parameters and to manage lesson and quizzes then showed to the users. The technological stack used is <a href='https://dart.dev/' target='_blank'>Dart</a> as programming language by leveraging on the <a href='https://flutter.dev/' target='_blank'>Flutter</a> framework, as well as the <a href='https://developer.android.com/studio?hl=en' target='_blank'>Android Studio</a> IDE for the mobile application, the <a href='https://react.dev/' target='_blank'>React</a> framework and <a href='https://code.visualstudio.com/' target='_blank'>VsCode</a> IDE, and using <a href='https://firebase.google.com/' target='_blank'>Firebase</a> as backend for the application.
